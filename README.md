# Time-Series-Analysis
Extract time series features for human activity monitoring.
The given information provides us with human activity data for 15 subjects. 
Considering accelerometer data for all the 15 subjects for walking, running, climbing up and climbing down, we are:

## Task 1:
- Applying natural visibility graph (NVG) and horizontal visibility graph (HVG) to the aforementioned data
- Computing the average degree, network diameter, and average path length
- Scatter plotting the results

## Task 2:
Considering the accelerometer data in all three directions
- Computing permutation entropy and complexity for the aforementioned data.
- Generating scatter plots:  
    - permutation entropy vs complexity and color the points according to walking and running. 
    - permutation entropy vs complexity and color the points according to climbing up and climbing down.
